Hi {{ticket.requester.first_name}},<br><br>

Thank you for reaching out to Trezor Support.<br><br>

Based on the transcript of your conversation with Hal (Trezor’s Virtual Agent), it appears that you are experiencing an
issue <strong>loading your accounts / discovery error</strong> in Trezor Suite.<br><br>

If your account information is not loading, and you see a “Discovery error,” this is usually due to a temporary
connection issue. Please rest assured that your funds are safe.<br><br>
